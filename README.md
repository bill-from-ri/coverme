# Cover Me

A browser-based tool that helps you quickly generate cover letters and respond to job application prompts using AI.

_Disclaimer:_ This project was meant as an exercise in building full-stack programs for AI-powered workflow automation. For the best possible results, modify the prompts in `main.py` to your personal standards. Generated text should always be reviewed and customized by the user. Always ensure that you read the job posting's AI use policy before submitting any text generated by this program.

## Features

- **Cover Letter Generator**: Create personalized cover letters from job descriptions
- **Prompt Responder**: Get AI-generated responses to application questions
- **Standalone Frontend**: Open `frontend.html` directly in your browser to use the app
- **PDF Workflow**: Upload your resume and cover letter template as PDFs
- **Edit & Save**: Manually edit generated text and save as PDF/TXT to `data/cover_letters/`

## Setup

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root. The backend uses LangChain's Google GenAI wrapper and reads `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. For convenience, it will fall back to `GEMINI_API_KEY` if present.
   ```
   # Preferred
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # Optional fallback (used only if GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Prepare Local Folders (auto-created if missing)**:
   - `data/` stores your resume (`resume.pdf`), and saved cover letters in `data/cover_letters/`
   - `templates/` stores your cover letter template (e.g., `cover_letter_template.pdf`)
   - These directories are ignored by git to protect your private files

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:8000`

## Use the Standalone Frontend (recommended)

Open `frontend.html` in your browser (double-click it or use `file:///` path). It connects to the local API at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Tabs

- **Uploads**: Upload your Resume (PDF) and Template (PDF)
- **Cover Letter**: Generate from a job description, edit the result, and save it as a cover letter (PDF/TXT)
- **Prompt**: Select one of your saved cover letters and generate an answer to an application prompt

## Install the Bookmarklet (optional)

1. Copy the entire contents of `bookmarklet.js`
2. Minify the file at `https://minify-js.com/`
3. Create a new bookmark in your browser
4. Edit the bookmark and paste the minified code as the URL (make sure to include the `javascript:` prefix)
5. Save the bookmark
6. Note: Some sites block bookmarklets from making external requests. If blocked, use `frontend.html` instead.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server (see Setup step 4)
2. Open `frontend.html` in your browser
3. In the **Uploads** tab, upload:
   - Resume as `PDF`
   - Cover letter template as `PDF`
   - These will be saved for future uses
4. In **Cover Letter** tab, paste the job description, click Generate, edit if needed, and Save as a cover letter
5. In **Prompt** tab, pick a saved cover letter, enter the prompt, and generate a response (editable)

## Customization

- Templates: place your template PDF in `templates/` (default name: `cover_letter_template.pdf`). You can specify a different template by name in the UI.
- Prompts: tweak prompt construction in `main.py` inside `generate_cover_letter()` and `respond_to_prompt()`.
- Styling: adjust UI in `frontend.html` and `bookmarklet.js`.
- Storage: cover letters are saved under `data/cover_letters/` as both `.pdf` and `.txt`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Modern web browser
- Gemini API key
